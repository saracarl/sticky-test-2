For me, I keep on drifting like a ship out on the sea. That afternoon two students from the academia showed him the town. <a href-\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1726\">Munich</a> was misbehaving, whipping his ass to ice while his shoes soaked through. His guides pointed at a clock in a blue tiled house. And tonight, every song he sings is written by <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692\">Shakespeare</a> and his mother-in-law. I love your baby. But it don't mean a goddamn thing. in trouble with every woman he's ever known all of them ugly skinny legs lie gap waiting behind the lips to suck in. Going down slow crooning <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692\">Shakespeare</a> say man must be careful when you kiss when he drunk. Going down for the third set pass the stragglers at the bar, the <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q543127\">bourbon</a> in his hand, some bitches cold, wet heart, the whole joint stinking on <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44\">beer</a> in love and winning now. So even the mistakes found like <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8341\">jazz</a>, poor me, moaning so no one hears. My home's in <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1588\">Louisiana</a>. My voice is wrong. I'm broke and can't hold my piss. My mother told me there'd be days like this.",

        "value": "There is a German painter from the 20s 30s. Named <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q703331\">Christian Schad</a>, who painted some of the most haunting <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134307\">portraits</a> I've ever seen. Because in his portraits you feel as if the person who is being portrayed is actually looking at you and studying you, you feel that you've been put on the spot. And he has a double <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134307\">portrait</a>, which was painted in 1929, in <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q64\">Berlin</a>, of a black woman from <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1019\">Madagascar</a>, who somehow, poor soul, also ended up in <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q64\">Berlin</a> in 1929. With a white man who had a <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1182746\">physical deformity</a>, so that he looked as if he had wings under his body. They appeared in a <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2591557\">freak show</a> together, he for physical reasons, but she mainly because in 1929, a black woman in <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q64\">Berlin</a> was considered a freak. And there was nothing wrong with her. They came they went under the billing Agosta the winged man and Rascha, the black dove, and this <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1028181\">painter</a> managed to portray them in such a way that you realize that anyone who has an eye in their head realizes how wrong this was. Agosta the winged man and Rascha the black dove. <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q703331\">Schad</a> paced the length of his <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q746628\">studio</a> and stopped at the wall, staring at a blank space behind him the clang and hum of <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q56161135\">Wardenberg Strasse</a> its <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1420\">automobiles</a> and organ grinders quarter to five. His eyes traveled to the <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q274988\">plaster</a> <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q732328\">scrollwork</a> on the ceiling. Did that hold back Heaven, he could not leave his skin. Once he painted himself in a new one. Silk green, worn like a shirt. He thought of Rascha so far from <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1019\">Madagascar</a>, turning slowly in place as the <a herf=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q215388\">boa constrictor</a> coiled counter wise its heavy love. How the spectators gawked, exhaling <a herf=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44\">beer</a> and sour <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3127419\">herring</a> sighs when the tent lights dimmed. Rascha went back to her trailer and plucked a <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q780\">chicken</a> for dinner. The <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12321255\">canvas</a> not his eye was merciless. He remembered Katya the Russian aristocrat, late for every sitting still fleeing the <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42976\">October Revolution</a>, how she clutched her sides and said not one word. Whereas Agosta the <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q384459\">doorbell</a> rang, was always on time. Lip curled as he spoke in wonder of women traveling backstage to offer him the consummate bloom of their lust. <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q703331\">Schad</a> would place him on a throne, quite cheap, tucked over his loins, the black suit jacket thrown off like a <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q516992\">cloak</a>. Agosta had told him of the students at the middle of the medical students at the shower at that chill arena where he perched on a cot his torso exposed his crests and fins a colony of birds trying to get out. And the students lumps caught in their throats, taking notes. Ah, Rascha's foot on the stair. She moved slowly as if she carried the <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q215388\">boa constrictor</a> around her body always. Once she brought fresh <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93189\">eggs</a> into the <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q746628\">studio</a> flecked and warm as well. Agosta in classical drapery then, and Rascha at his feet without passion. Not the <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12321255\">canvas</a>, but their gaze. So calm was merciless.",
